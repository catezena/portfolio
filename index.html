                <a href="https://github.com/catezena/SECURE-LOGIN-SYSTEM.git">SECURE-LOGIN-SYSTEM</a>:Description: I developed a secure authentication system with robust protection against SQL injection and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. The system utilized hashing algorithms for password storage and implemented session management to ensure user safety during login processes.

                Key Skills Used: Database management, encryption, and vulnerability testing.
                
                Technologies: Java, MySQL, and bcrypt for password hashing.
                
                My Role: Designed the database schema,
                
                implemented login functionality, and tested the system for common security vulnerabilities.

By leveraging network analysis tools like Wireshark, I was able to identify vulnerabilities in data transmission and enhance application security. The project required a strong understanding of network protocols and an ability to interpret complex data flow patterns.

                Key Skills Used: Network analysis, Python scripting, and secure coding practices.
                
                Technologies: Python, Wireshark, and HTTP protocols.
                
                My Role: Designed and developed the tool, tested various use cases, and documented the findings with actionable security recommendations.
